Traffic collision avoidance system for driverless vehicles using neural networks.
# Abstract
The dawn of the 21st century saw the rise of big data and its accompanying Artificial 
Intelligence. Implementing such techniques into driverless vehicles can fetch fruitful results to 
answer the overwhelming dilemma of predicting uncertainties in a conventional, rule-based 
Automated Driving System due to human participation. In this project, an end-to-end deep 
reinforcement learning model has been developed to implement a collision-avoidance system 
in autonomous cars. The model is evaluated in controlled scenarios of increasing difficulty, 
and its performance is examined via metrics provided by CARLA, an open-source simulator 
for autonomous driving research.
